The song is built like concrete poetry - the phrase 'batmacumbaiêiê batmacumbaobá' is sung in full, then a syllable drops with each repetition, changing the meaning, then builds back up. On the page, Augusto de Campos laid out the lyrics so the shape of the words forms what looks like bat wings - or Batman's ears. Even if you don't speak Portuguese, you can feel it.",

The song is written as if it's a critique of the Catholic church but it was actually a critique of the government. Artists had to find clever ways to slip things past actual government agencies that would review content. I can't believe how possible this seems in 2026.",
